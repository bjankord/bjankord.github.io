Hello, my name is **Brett Jankord**. Iâ€™m a front-end software engineer at [Cerner](http://www.cerner.com/) in Kansas City, MO. I enjoy building responsive, performance-focused web sites.

Along with web development, I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking and riding my bike. I love to listen to music, browse through interwebs, and spending time with my wife and our two little ones.
