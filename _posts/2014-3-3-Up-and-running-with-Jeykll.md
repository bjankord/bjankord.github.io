title: Up and running with Jekyll!
---

I've worked with Jeykll and Octopress some, but have never taken the time to set up an instance for myself. [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/) has a nice [article on Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) that makes it super easy to get set up with using Jeykll with GitHub pages. After reading the article I decided I'd finally go ahead and set up one for my GitHub account.

I'm currently using Barry's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme. I plan to update the site with my own custom theme and begin testing ideas around improving page speed on this site. I want to say thank you to Barry Clark, his article and Jekyll now repo made setting up a instance of Jeykll super easy. I think I was up and running in less than 15 minutes which is a lot faster than the first time I played around with Jeykll.
